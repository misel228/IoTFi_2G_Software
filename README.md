# IoTFi-2G-Software

 <img src ="https://github.com/sbcshop/IoTFi/blob/main/images/IotFi%202G.png" />

IoT-Fi is a compact low power IoT enabled device having the capability of GSM modules (SIM868/SIM7600G-H) for providing network connectivity via using sim card and having the power of RP2040 chip. It also consists of an LCD 1.14” display, ESP32-C3, a 3.5mm jack for audio I/p - o/p, SD card and SIM card slot.

## Features:
* ESP-32(C3)
* USB type-C for power-up board and uploading codes in rp2040
* Five user Buttons
* SD card slot for storing data
* On Board RP2040
* Two antenna connectors
* A 3.5mm jack for audio input output
* 1.14 LCD display

## Features of SIM868:

* Small in size quad band (GSM/GPRS + GNSS)
* LCC + LGA form factor with abundant interfaces including UART, USB2.0, GPIO, etc.
* Low power consumption
* Embedded TCP/UDP Protocols

## Downloading IDE
* To open upython(.py) files you should have Thonny IDE installed in your system, If you don’t have Thonny IDE follow the link below to install it
*  https://thonny.org/
* For brief discriptions on how to get satrt with PICO rp2040, click on link below:

## For setup the Board in thonny </b>
* Now connect USB Cable on USB Port of Pico.
* Open Thonny IDE and Choose interpreter as MicroPython (Raspberry Pi pico).

## Working With IoTFi-2G

To start working with our this board we have provided few basics examples according to features included in this board. You can smply run the pyhon example code in your board by downloading and extracting this repository in your system. Below is the brief description of Example codes:

* ***Accelerometer_Example*** this is the simple application of tilt indication in the four direction (i.e, Left, Right, Forward and , Backward). When you will upload this code in your baoard will see a ***box*** appearing according to the direction in which your board tilted. In case of no tilt it will show a message in display.
